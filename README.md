# challenge-6-coding-quiz

## Description 

This website presents a coding quiz which tests the user's knowledge of Javascript. 
Functionality was built using Javascript, which allowed us to set a timer once the user starts the quiz, provide the user with a series of questions, record the number of correct answers and store the user's initials and score into local storage to be recorded on the highscores page. Answering questions incorrectly subtracts a few seconds from the timer. The quiz ends once timer runs out or user answers all questions.
